Readme - PseudoSib

Last update: 07/02/2018

1. Installation:

$ git clone LINKSITEAQUI
$ make

2. Usage:
$ ./pseudosib -i <input.ped> -o <output.txt> -c <int> -m <int> [-h] [-n <string>] [-s <string>] [-g <int>]

2.1. Options:
-h, --help 	 	 	 Help screen and software version;
-c, --covariables <int> 	 Number of covariables;
-m, --markers <int> 	 	 Number of markers;
-n, --notavailable <string> 	 Code for 'Not available' in output 'point' (default) or 'na';
-s, --separated <string> 	 Separation character in output 'space' (default) or 'tab';
-g, --genotypes <int> 	 	 Number of columns used for genotypes in output '1' (default) or '2'.

2.2. PED file

First header row with the markrs names (alphanumeric) separated by space or tab should be given.

The PED file is a white-space (space OR tab) delimited file, the first six columns are mandatory:

    Family ID		(numeric)
    Individual ID	(numeric, should be uniquely to identify a person)
    Paternal ID		(numeric)
    Maternal ID		(numeric)
    Sex			(1=male; 2=female; 0=unknown)
    Phenotype		(1=unaffected; 2=affected; 0=missing)

After that comes the columns of Covariables, thei can be either a quantitative trait or a qualitative trait, but only numeric vallues.
Quantitative traits with decimal points must be coded with a period/full-stop character and not a comma, i.e. 2.394 not 2,394.
There is no pre-set limit for the number of variables, but the number of variables used must be entered in the command line in the argument "-c". The number of qualitative variables should be the same for all individuals.

Then that comes the columns of Genotypes. Thei should also be white-space delimited; they can be 1,2,3,4 or 0 which is, by default, the missing genotype character. All markers should be biallelic and must have two alleles specified. Either Both alleles should be missing (i.e. 0) or neither.

2.2.1 Exemple

File with 1 families of 3 people, 3 markers and 1 covariable:

	mark1 mark2 mark3
	1 1 2 3 1 2 20 1 2 3 3 4 1
	1 2 0 0 1 1 50 1 2 2 3 1 1
	1 3 0 0 2 1 60 1 2 3 2 4 4
